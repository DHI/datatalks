# An Introduction (to an Introduction) to Time Series

- by: Jaume Palmer (JAPR) | September 2024

## Abstract:

In the wake of DL, numerous advanced methods have emerged to capture complex temporal patterns in data. However, simpler models might sometimes be sufficient and, more importantly, trying them will always be insightful. The prime example is the ARIMA toolbox, a collection of statistical methods that are light, robust and, in the right context, very powerful. This talk introduces some of the mathematical concepts behind ARIMA models while applying them to forecast water consumption.
