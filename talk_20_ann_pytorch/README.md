# A brief introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch

By Henrik Andersson

As a continuation of  Data Talk 17 on machine learning, we are now moving on to neural networks, the foundation for deep learning. Some concepts that will be mentioned are tensors, activation functions, and gradient descent optimization. We will show the power of neural networks to approximate non-linear functions and how to create a small neural network in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) that can be trained on a regular laptop.
