# Talk 30 - Data science with Polars

Polars is a modern Dataframe library, that solves many of the pain points of pandas. It is faster, more memory efficient, and has a more modern API.

If you struggle with large datasets, or if you are looking for a more modern and efficient way to work with data, Polars is a great alternative to pandas.

In this talk, we will learn how to use Polars to manipulate data and perform common data science tasks, such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data. We will also touch upon how to create visualizations and produce formatted tables.
