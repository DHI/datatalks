# agenda

- general introduction LLM  
- examples chatgpt (record some in case it doesn't work)  
	- reformatting table  
	- explain code
    - quick insight into some area (CAREFUL)    
- example copilot  
	- quick functions
    - plotting and formatting (e.g. annotations) 
- where is this going   

- what does it mean for us?   

# general introduction LLM

- large language models = LLM
- LLMs are trained on large amounts of text

# notes on using ChatGPT for code

- Explain code
- Improved existing code
- Rewrite code using correct style (refactor code made by non-native Python devs)
- Rewrite code using ideomatic constructs (make code Pythonic)
- Simplify code
- Exploring alternatives
- Writing documentation
- Writing tests
- Tracking down bugs


# github copilot

- https://copilot.github.com/
- https://copilot.github.com/blog/introducing-copilot


# where is it going 
- many things still unclear


## criticism
- privacy  
- data security  
- intellectual property  
- citing "written in cooperation with chatGPT"  


- prohibitive cost to train LLM from scratch
- some variety in LLMs will exist 

- adoption  
    	- domain knowledge infused LLMs

# what does it mean for us?

- if everyone can use it, everyone can do it --> basic programming skills no longer USP  
- adapt to leverage higher productivity
