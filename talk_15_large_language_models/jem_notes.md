# Notes

This week’s topic: “Using AI assistants for text and code”

Enhance your text writing and code work with Large Language Model AI assistants. Join us to learn about the benefits of using ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in your daily work. ChatGPT can assist you in generating and revising text for proposals, reports and mails. Both GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT can help you become much more efficient in writing code. We will give examples on both text and code workflows during the talk and we hope that you will contribute with your ideas on how these new technologies can improve our work in DHI.


## Examples text

### Example 1: Reformulating

You have written something quickly (maybe as non-native English speaker), but need help improving the text. 

Advise: 

* Give ChatGPT as much context as possible (e.g. "I'm an engineer working in ... and I need to ...." )
* Don't give up if first version isn't great 
     - explain how you would like it changed 
     - or simply press re-generate



### Example 2: Summarising text





### Example 3: Translation 




## Examples code

### Example 1: You need to code something but you don't know how

Could be short or long pieces of code 

* ChatGPT: just ask as you would ask a colleague
* Copilot: 
    - Just start writting (e.g. a function name)
    - Express your intent in a comment 



### Example 2: You would like to improve existing code (refactor)

* More efficient
* 


### Example 3: Write tests for existing code

You're developing a Python package, and need to test that it works as intended. Writting proper tests can be tedious. Let AI assistants help - they are great at repetitive tasks. 


### Example 4: Translate to another languge

You have a function in matlab but would like a Python version... 


## Main messages

* Think of these tools as your *assistant* - you are *responsible* for the final result
* Don't feed them confidential information about your work (or private life)
* Be careful about using them for researching topics - answers can look very convincing but still be wrong
* Should you cite ChatGPT (e.g. "this text was written with assistance from ChatGPT")? Not sure yet???
